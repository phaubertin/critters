Critters must catch food, represented by green circles, and avoid predators,
represented by red squares. The brain of each critter is a small feedforward
neural network (14 neurons).

Brains are trained in the background using a genetic algorithm. The graphical
user interface (GUI) is updated every 20 seconds with the five best brains of
the current generation (which makes them absolutely useless for the first 20
seconds).
